# AEDA
Algorithms and Data Structure studies for FEUP. This repository contain exercises and (in a near future) 2 projects.

## Exercises 

The instructions for each problem are located in [Instructions](https://github.com/Jumaruba/AEDA/tree/master/Instructions) only in portuguese.  
The solutions have a folder called `lib` for [googleTest testing framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) and a `Tests` which contains the code for the problem and test cases.
